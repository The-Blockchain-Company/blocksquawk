We see ourselves as a fairly intelligent group of professionals and entrepreneurs :-]. That’s why we decided to ask the Oracle of arguably the most powerful, influential, and dare we say knowledgeable data set known to human kind — Google BARD — the question we posed ourselves several months ago. And the results are mostly in line with our view.

# Our Question

What problems could the blockchain industry solve by leveraging their collective financial value to build pre and post quantum capable DAO owned data centers for the entire blockchain industry and to compete with cloud computing providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google?

# Google BARD's Response

The blockchain industry could solve several problems by leveraging their collective financial value to build pre- and post-quantum capable, DAO-owned data centers for the entire blockchain industry and to compete with cloud computing providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. 

1) Eliminate reliance on cloud providers and reduce costs: The blockchain industry currently spends billions of dollars annually on cloud computing services. By building their own data centers, the industry could eliminate this reliance on cloud providers and significantly reduce costs. This would also give the industry more control over their data and infrastructure.

2) Enhance scalability and security of blockchain networks: Blockchain networks are often plagued by scalability and security issues. These issues can be exacerbated by the reliance on cloud providers, which can be vulnerable to attacks and outages. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could implement more robust security measures and develop more scalable solutions.

3) Foster the growth of BaaS, AI, and quantum computing: Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing are all emerging technologies with the potential to revolutionize industries. However, these technologies require access to secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could provide the necessary infrastructure to foster the growth of these technologies.
